There is no single 1.5°C warmer world, and <em>projections</em> of 1.5°C warmer worlds look different depending on whether it is considered on a near-term transient trajectory or at climate equilibrium after several millennia, and, in both cases, if it occurs with or without <em>overshoot</em>. Within the 21st century, several aspects play a role for the assessment of <em>risk</em> and potential <em>impacts</em> in 1.5°C warmer worlds: the possible occurrence, magnitude and duration of an overshoot; the way in which emissions reductions are achieved; the ways in which policies might be able to influence the <em>resilience</em> of human and natural systems; and the nature of the regional and sub-regional risks. Beyond the 21st century, several elements of the <em>climate system</em> would continue to change even if the global mean temperatures remain stable, including further increases of sea level.</p></dd><div>

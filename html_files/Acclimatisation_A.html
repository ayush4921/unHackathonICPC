Through acclimatisation, the individual maintains performance across a range of environmental conditions. For a clear differentiation between findings in laboratory and field studies, the term ‘acclimation’ is used in ecophysiology for the respective phenomena when observed in well-defined experimental settings. The term ‘(adaptive) plasticity’ characterises the generally limited scope of changes in phenotype that an individual can reach through the process of acclimatisation.</p></dd><div>

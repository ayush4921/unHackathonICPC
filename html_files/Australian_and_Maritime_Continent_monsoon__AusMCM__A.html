The AusMCM is characterized by the seasonal reversal of prevailing easterly winds to westerly winds and the onset of periods of active convection and heavy rainfall. Over northern Australia, the monsoon season generally lasts from December to March and is associated with west to north-westerly inflow of moist winds, producing convection and heavy precipitation. Over the Maritime Continent, the main rainy season south of the equator is centred on December to February with north-westerly monsoon flow at low levels. Further details on how AusMCM is defined and used throughout the Report are provided in Annex V.</p><div class="p-3 small"><h6 class="fs-6">Parent-term</h6><ul class="items text-muted fs-6"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Global monsoon" data-phraseid="4690">Global monsoon</span></li></ul></div></dd></div><div>

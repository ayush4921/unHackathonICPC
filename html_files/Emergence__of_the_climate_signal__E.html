Emergence can refer to changes relative to a historical or modern baseline (usually at least 20 years long) and can also be expressed in terms of time (<em>time of emergence</em>) or in terms of a global warming level. Emergence is also used to refer to a time when we can expect to see a response to reducing <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> emissions (emergence with respect to <em>mitigation</em>). Emergence can be estimated using observations and/or model simulations.</p></dd><div>

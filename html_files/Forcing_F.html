The traditional radiative&nbsp;forcing is computed with all tropospheric properties held fixed at their unperturbed values, and after&nbsp;allowing for stratospheric temperatures, if perturbed, to readjust to radiative-dynamical equilibrium.&nbsp;Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for.&nbsp;The radiative forcing once rapid adjustments are accounted for is termed the effective radiative&nbsp;forcing. Radiative forcing is not to be confused with cloud radiative forcing, which describes an<br>unrelated measure of the impact of clouds on the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere.</p></dd><div>

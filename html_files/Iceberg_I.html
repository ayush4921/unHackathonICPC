Smaller pieces of floating ice known as ‘bergy bits’ (less than 5 m above sea level) or ‘growlers’ (less than 2 m above sea level) can originate from glaciers or ice shelves, or from the breaking up of a large iceberg. Icebergs can also be classified by shape, most commonly being either tabular (steep sides and a flat top) or non-tabular (varying shapes, with domes and spires) (NOAA, 2021). In lakes, icebergs can originate by breaking off shelf ice, which forms through freezing of a lake surface.</p></dd><div>

They are one of the main tools for undertaking integrated assessments. One class of IAM used with respect to climate change <em>mitigation</em> may include representations of: multiple sectors of the economy, such as energy, <em>land use</em> and <em>land-use change</em>; interactions between sectors; the economy as a whole; associated <em>greenhouse gas (GHG)</em> emissions and <em>sinks</em>; and reduced representations of the <em>climate system</em>. This class of model is used to assess linkages between economic, social and technological development and the evolution of the climate system. Another class of IAM additionally includes representations of the costs associated with climate change <em>impacts</em>, but includes less detailed representations of economic systems. These can be used to assess impacts and mitigation in a cost–benefit framework and have been used to estimate the social cost of carbon.</p></dd><div>

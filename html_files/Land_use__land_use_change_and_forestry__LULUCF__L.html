Following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories and their 2019 Refinement, ‘anthropogenic’ land-related GHG fluxes are defined as all those occurring on ‘managed land’, that is, ‘where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions’. Since managed land may include carbon dioxide (CO2) removals not considered as ‘anthropogenic’ in some of the scientific literature assessed in this report (e.g., removals associated with CO2 fertilisation and N deposition), the land-related net GHG emission estimates from global models included in this report are not necessarily directly comparable with LULUCF estimates in National GHG Inventories.

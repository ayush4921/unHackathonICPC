The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific <em>radiative forcing</em> characteristics. The term pathway emphasises that not only the long-term concentration levels are of interest, but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome (Moss et al., 2010; van Vuuren et al., 2011).</p><br>
RCPs usually refer to the portion of the concentration pathway extending up to 2100, for which <em>integrated assessment models</em> produced corresponding emission scenarios. Extended concentration pathways describe extensions of the RCPs from 2100 to 2300 that were calculated using simple rules generated by stakeholder consultations, and do not represent fully consistent scenarios. Four RCPs produced from integrated assessment models were selected from the published literature and used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment and are also used in this Assessment for comparison, spanning the range from approximately below 2°C warming to high (&gt;4°C) warming best-estimates by the end of the 21st century: RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 and RCP8.5.<br><br>
<p>• RCP2.6: One pathway where radiative forcing peaks at approximately 3 W m<sup>–2</sup> and then declines to be limited at 2.6 W m<sup>–2</sup> in 2100 (the corresponding Extended Concentration Pathway, or ECP, has constant emissions after 2100).</p><br>
<p>• RCP4.5 and RCP6.0: Two intermediate stabilisation pathways in which radiative forcing is limited at approximately 4.5 W m<sup>–2</sup> and 6.0 W m<sup>–2</sup> in 2100 (the corresponding ECPs have constant concentrations after 2150).</p><br>
<p>• RCP8.5: One high pathway which leads to &gt;8.5 W m<sup>–2</sup> in 2100 (the corresponding ECP has constant emissions after 2100 until 2150 and constant concentrations after 2250).</p><p></p><div class="p-3 small"><h6 class="fs-6">Parent-term</h6><ul class="items text-muted fs-6"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Pathways" data-phraseid="493">Pathways</span></li></ul></div></dd></div><div>

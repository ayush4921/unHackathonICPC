The term adjustment time is also used to characterize the adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change in the <em>source</em> strength. Half-life or decay constant is used to quantify a first-order exponential decay process. See <em>Response time or adjustment time</em> for a different definition pertinent to <em>climate</em> variations.<br><br><br><br><br>
</p><p>The term lifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as a surrogate for adjustment time.</p><br>
<br> <br> <br><br><br><br>
<p>In simple cases, where the global removal of the compound is directly proportional to the total mass of the reservoir, the adjustment time equals the <em>turnover time</em>: T = T<sub>a</sub>. An example is CFC-11, which is removed from the <em>atmosphere</em> only by photochemical processes in the <em>stratosphere</em>. In more complicated cases, where several reservoirs are involved or where the removal is not proportional to the total mass, the equality T = T<sub>a</sub> no longer holds. <br><br><em>Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</em> is an extreme example. Its turnover time is only about 4 years because of the rapid exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean and terrestrial biota. However, a large part of that CO<sub>2</sub> is returned to the atmosphere within a few years. The adjustment time of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is determined from the rates of removal of carbon by a range of processes with time scales from months to hundreds of thousands of years.&nbsp;As a result, 15 to 40% of an emitted&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;pulse will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years, 10 to 25% will remain about ten thousand years, and the rest will be removed over several hundred thousand years.&nbsp;<br><br>In the case of <em>methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</em>, the adjustment time is different from the turnover time because the removal is mainly through a chemical reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH), the concentration of which itself depends on the CH<sub>4</sub> concentration. Therefore, the CH<sub>4</sub> removal rate S is not proportional to its total mass M.</p><p></p><div class="p-3 small"><h6 class="fs-6">Parent-term</h6><ul class="items text-muted fs-6"><li><span class="specificlink" data-report="AR6" data-phrase="Lifetime" data-phraseid="2524">Lifetime</span></li></ul></div></dd></div><div>

Global mean&nbsp;sea level change resulting from change in the mass of the ocean is&nbsp;called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level change due to the<br>addition or removal of a mass of water is called its sea level equivalent&nbsp;(SLE). Sea level changes, both globally and locally, resulting from&nbsp;changes in water density are called steric. Density changes induced&nbsp;by temperature changes only are called thermosteric, while density&nbsp;changes induced by salinity changes are called halosteric. Barystatic<br>and steric sea level changes do not include the effect of changes in the&nbsp;shape of ocean basins induced by the change in the ocean mass and&nbsp;its distribution.</p></dd><div>

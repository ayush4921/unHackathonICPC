It entered into force in March 1994 and, as of September 2020, had 197 Parties (196 States and the European Union). The Convention’s ultimate objective is the ‘stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’ (UNFCCC, 1992). The provisions of the Convention are pursued and implemented by two further treaties: the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.</p></dd><div>

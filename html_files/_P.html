Climate-related data derived in this way are referred to as proxy data, and time series of proxy data are proxy records. Examples of proxy types include pollen assemblages, <em>tree ring</em> widths, speleothem and coral geochemistry, and various data derived from marine sediments and glacier ice. Proxy data can be calibrated to provide quantitative climate information.</p></dd><div>
